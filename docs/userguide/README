To build (and/or make changes to) the upcoming version of the User Guide:

Install the following (these are the FreeBSD package names):

- devel/git
- textproc/py-sphinx

Check out the source code from git:

% cd /path/to/your-build-directory
% git clone git://github.com/freenas/freenas.git
% cd /path/to/your-build-directory/freenas/docs/userguide

NOTE: all of the following commands should be run from /path/to/your-build-directory/freenas/docs/userguide.

To set up the doc build environment for the first time:

% sphinx-quickstart 

If you want to edit the User Guide, make changes to *.rst file for the chapter to edit, using any ASCII text editor.
Refer to http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html for formatting syntax.
Refer to http://wiki.typo3.org/Editors_%28reST%29 for a list of reST editors.
Need help getting started or want to discuss edits? Join the http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-docs mailing list.

To build a local copy of the HTML, run this command in /path/to/your-build-directory/freenas/docs/userguide:

% sphinx-build -b html . _build

When finished, open _build/freenas.html in a browser to verify the HTML output.

To build a PDF version of the userguide you will need a few extra packages:

- print/tex-formats (this will pull in a LOT of dependencies)
- print/tex-dvipsk
- devel/gmake

Run this command *twice* to build the PDF:

% yes '' | gmake latexpdf

When finished running the second time, you will find the PDF in _build/latex/FreeNAS.pdf.
