Process Pool

Some python libraries (namely, `py-libzfs`) are not thread-safe. Methods that use such libraries should be executed in a
separate process to avoid non-safe behavior.

Middleware services that include these methods are marked with `process_pool = True`. All their synchronous methods are
executed in a shared process pool:

  .. literalinclude:: /../../src/middlewared/middlewared/main.py
      :pyobject: Middleware.__init_procpool

Eliminating deadlocks
*********************

All asynchronous methods of process pool-powered services (including inherited ones) need to have their synchronous
version named `{method}__sync`. The most important example is `CRUDService.get_instance__sync`.

Why is this needed? Imagine we have a `ZFSSnapshotService` service that uses a process pool. Let's say its `create`
method calls `zfs.snapshot.get_instance` to return the result. That call will have to be forwarded to the main
middleware process, which will call `zfs.snapshot.query` in the process pool. If the process pool is already exhausted,
it will lead to a deadlock.

By executing a synchronous implementation of the same method in the same process pool we eliminate **Hold and wait**
condition and prevent deadlock situation from arising.
