The Makefile in this directory facilitates production of a `netboot.gz' boot
image which -- when booted -- performs the following actions (in order):

	1. Obtain a DHCP address
	2. Mount a path configured in (loader.conf(5)) from the DHCP server
	   NB: If `boot.nfsroot.path' is set, NFS is used, otherwise...
	   NB: If `boot.smbroot.share' is set, SMB is used
	3. `chroot' into the mounted directory, executing `/bin/sh /etc/rc'

This allows you to build miniaturized ISO files that boot via CD, DVD, HDD, USB
Thumb drive, or (most notably) PXE that -- when booted -- can use this
`netboot.gz' to chain-load to an NFS or SMB exported media (such as installer)
using the native networking framework (opposed to using the UNDI framework).

The `netboot.gz' is built from scratch by the code contained within `Makefile'.
How to make `netboot.gz'...

	First, create the file `static.conf'. You can copy `static.conf.sample'
	if you like, or alternatively execute the following command to create a
	minimal `static.conf' file:

		sysrc -f static.conf \
			STATIC_BASE=/ OUTPUT=netboot.gz DESTDIR=/boot

	This configures where the binaries for `static/' are pulled from
	(STATIC_BASE), the name of the boot image (OUTPUT), and also the
	destination to copy the boot image during `make install' (DESTDIR).
	NB: Only base system utils and config files are pulled into `static/'.
	NB: Ideally, you'd set STATIC_BASE to an unpacked ISO directory.
	NB: DESTDIR is usually `STATIC_BASE/boot'.

	Execute `make' which performs the following:
	1. Reads config file `./static.conf'
	2. Copies required binaries, libraries, and configuration files to
	   `static/' from the path configured in `./static.conf' as
	   STATIC_BASE="..."
	3. Creates an empty `dep/mfsroot.gz' to build `netboot.gz' from
	4. Copies `dep/mfsroot.gz' to `./netboot.gz' (./OUTPUT)
	5. Uncompresses and mounts `netboot.gz' (OUTPUT) on `./mnt'
	6. Copies the contents of `./static' into `./mnt'
	7. Copies the contents of `./src' into `./mnt'
	8. Unmounts and re-compresses `netboot.gz' (OUTPUT)

The compiled `netboot.gz' (OUTPUT) is suitable for use as an `mfs_root' module
providing a root filesystem that will chain-load a new root via NFS or SMB. To
tell your kernel to automatically load `netboot.gz' as your boot image during
startup, place the following directives in `/boot/loader.conf':

	mfsroot_load="YES"
	mfsroot_type="mfs_root"
	mfsroot_name="boot/netboot"
	vfs.root.mountfrom="ufs:/dev/md0"
	vfs.root.mountfrom.options="rw"

Then configure (in the same `/boot/loader.conf') one of the following:

	# To mount an NFS share from the DHCP server
	boot.nfsroot.path="/path/to/root"

	# To mount an SMB share from the DHCP server
	boot.smbroot.share="sharename"
