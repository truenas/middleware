SETUP
=====

FreeBSD packages

The following packages from FreeBSD ports must be installed:
  - lang/python27
  - misc/py-pexpect
  - devel/py-pip
  - x11-servers/xorg-vfbserver

Python packages
===============
The following package is not in FreeBSD ports but must be installed:

(see https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter )


SAMPLE STEPS
============
(1)  Copy the config.json.template to another file.  Remove all
     comments from the file, such as myconfig.json

(2)  Edit myconfig.json with the appropriate parameters for
     your test, such as ISO image, VM name, tap interface, etc.

(3)  If running a VM under BHyve, set up the tap interface:
         python setup-tap.py -f myconfig.json

(4)  To test doing a clean install from ISO into a BHyve VM run:
         python test-inst-001.py -f myconfig.json

(5)  To test running a BHyve VM which has already been created:
         python test-run-001.py -f myconfig.json
