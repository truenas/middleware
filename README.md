## Pull Request Instructions / Jenkins Commands

When submitting a pull-request, Jenkins will attempt to verify the changes to ensure it does not break our builds and/or passes QA tests.

Once whitelisted, the following commands may be used to interact with that service:

    "ok to test" to accept this pull request for testing
    "test this please" for a one time test run
    "add to whitelist" to add the author to the whitelist

If the build fails for other various reasons you can rebuild.

    "retest this please" to start a new build
    "retest this please CLEAN" to start a new build, non-incremental
