Creating delicious APIs for Django apps since 2010.

Here are some common reasons for tastypie:

    * You need an API that is RESTful and uses HTTP well.
    * You want to support deep relations.
    * You DON'T want to have to write your own serializer to make the output
      right.
    * You want an API framework that has little magic, very flexible and maps
      well to the problem domain.
    * You want/need XML serialization that is treated equally to JSON (and
      YAML is there too).
    * You want to support my perceived NIH syndrome, which is less about
      NIH and more about trying to help out friends/coworkers.
