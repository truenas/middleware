GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader.  It was derived from GRUB, the GRand
Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich 
Stefan Boleyn.

This port does not install GRUB on the master boot record of your hard drive.
To do this you will need to read the info page that is installed by the port.

This port includes additional patches and fixes making it work properly
with ZFS boot-environments. Users on UFS will probably want to install the
regular sysutils/grub2 port.
