gevent is a coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlet to
provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the libevent event loop.

Features include:
- Fast event loop based on libevent (epoll on Linux, kqueue on FreeBSD).
- Lightweight execution units based on greenlet.
- API that re-uses concepts from the Python standard library (for example there
  are Events and Queues).
- Cooperative sockets with SSL support.
- DNS queries performed through libevent-dns.
- Monkey patching utility to get 3rd party modules to become cooperative.
- Fast WSGI server based on libevent-http

gevent is inspired by eventlet but features more consistent API, simpler
implementation and better performance. Read why others use gevent and check out
