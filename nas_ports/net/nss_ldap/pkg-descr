nss_ldap is a NSS module which provides an LDAP backend for C library
functions such as getpwnam(3), getgrnam(3), and gethostbyname(3).  It
is compliant with RFC 2307, ``An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network
Information Service''.

Currently this is an experimental port, with support only for the
`passwd' and `group' databases.
