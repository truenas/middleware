To build the system (experts only):

Requirements:

- Your build environment must be FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE or newer.
- amd64 or i386 for i386 builds; an amd64 for amd64 builds.
- You will need the following ports/packages when compiling anything
  FreeNAS-related:
  - devel/git
  - sysutils/cdrtools
  - archivers/pxz
  (and all the dependencies that these ports/pkgs install, of course)

Building the System Quickstart Flow:

- Checking out the code from git:

% cd /path/to/your-build-filesystem
% git clone git://github.com/freenas/freenas.git
% cd freenas

- Build it

% make git-external
% make release

This will also fetch TrueOS and ports for the build from github.

The End Result:

If your build completes successfully, you'll have both 32 and 64 bit
release products in the release_stage directory.  You will also have
a tarball in your build directory containing the entire release for
easy transport.
