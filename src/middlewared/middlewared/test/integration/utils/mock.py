    """
    Context manager that temporarily replaces specified middleware `method` with a mock.

    This only works for method calls dispatched with `self.middleware.call` or `self.middleware.call_sync`. Direct class
    method calls (e.g. `self.get_disk_from_partition(...)`) will not be affected.

    :param method: Method name to replace

    :params args: Only use this mock when the method is called with the specified arguments.

    :param return_value: The value returned when the mock is called.

    :param declaration: A string, containing python function declaration for mock. Function should be named `mock`,
        can be normal function or `async` and must accept `self` argument and all other arguments the function being
        replaced accepts. No `@accepts`, `@job` or other decorators are required, but if a method being replaced is a
        job, then mock signature must also accept `job` argument.

    :param remote: Mock this method on another node of the HA setup instead.
