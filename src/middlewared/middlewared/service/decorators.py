def job(

    """
    Flag method as a long-running job. This must be the first decorator to be applied (meaning that it must be specified
    the last).

    Methods wrapped with this decorator must accept :class:`middlewared.job.Job` object as their first argument.

    :param lock: Determines a lock for this job to use. Locks prevent duplicate jobs that do the same work or access
        a shared resource from running at the same time. First job that obtains a lock will execute normally,
        subsequent jobs will stay in the `WAITING` state until the first job completes.

        Lock namespace is global. That way, if the method `"disk.wipe"` obtains a lock `"disk:sdb"`, then the method
        `"disk.format"` will have to wait for the same lock `"disk:sdb"` to be released.

        `lock` can be a constant string (for example, `lock='boot_scrub'`) or a callable that will accept the job's
        arguments and produce a lock name, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: python

            @job(lock=lambda args: f'scrub:{args[0]}')
            def scrub(self, pool_name):

        Please beware that, as `@job` decorator must be executed before `@api_method`, the arguments passed to the lock
        callable will be the raw arguments given by caller (there would be no arguments sanitizing or added defaults).

        Default value is `None` meaning that no locking is used.

    :param lock_queue_size: How many jobs with this lock can be in the `WAITING` state. For example, there is no sense
        to queue the same cloud sync or pool scrub twice, so we specify `lock_queue_size=1`. The first called cloud sync
        will run normally; then, if we call a second cloudsync with the same id while the first is still running, it
        will be queued; and then, if we call a third cloudsync, it won't be queued anymore.

        If lock queue size is exceeded then the new job is discarded and the `id` of the last job in the queue is
        returned.

        If lock queue size is zero, then launching a job when another job with the same lock is running will raise an
        `EBUSY` error.

        Default value is `5`. `None` would mean that lock queue is infinite.

    :param logs: If `True` then `job.logs_fd` object will be available. It is an unbuffered file opened in binary mode;
        the job can write its logs there, and they will be available in the `/var/log/jobs/{id}.log` file. By default,
        no such file is opened.

    :param process: If `True` then the job body is called in a separate process. By default, job body is executed in the
        main middleware process.

    :param pipes: A list of pipes a job can have. A job can have `pipes=["input"]` pipe, `pipes=["output"]` pipe
        or both at the same time.

        Pipes allow us to pass streaming data to/from a job. Job can read its input pipe via `job.pipes.input.r` and
        write to its output pipe via `job.pipes.output.w`. Both are binary mode streams. By default, no pipes are
        opened.

    :param check_pipes: If `True`, then the job will check that all its specified pipes are opened (it's the caller's
        responsibility to open the pipes). If `False`, then the job must explicitly run `job.check_pipe("input")`
        before accessing the pipe. This is useful when a job might or might need a pipe depending on its call arguments.
        By default, all pipes are checked.

    :param transient: If `True` then `"core.get_jobs"` ADDED or CHANGED event won't be sent for this job, and it will
        be removed from `core.get_jobs` upon completion. This is useful for periodic service jobs that we don't want
        to see in task manager UI. By default, the job is not transient.

    :param description: A callable that will return the job's human-readable description (that will appear in the task
        manager UI) based on its passed arguments. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

                @job(description=lambda dev, mode, *args: f'Wipe disk {dev}')

        Please beware that, as `@job` decorator must be executed before `@api_method`, the arguments passed to the
        description callable will be the raw arguments given by caller (there would be no arguments sanitizing or added
        defaults).

    :param abortable: If `True` then the job can be aborted in the task manager UI. When the job is aborted,
        `asyncio.CancelledError` is raised inside the job method (meaning that only asynchronous job methods can be
        aborted). By default, jobs are not abortable.

    :param read_roles: A list of roles that will allow a non-full-admin user to see this job in `core.get_jobs`
        and download its logs even if the job was launched by another user or by the system.

        By default, non-full-admin users already can see their own jobs and download their logs, so this only should
        be used when the job is launched externally (i.e., using crontab).
