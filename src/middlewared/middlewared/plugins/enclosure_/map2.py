    """Purpose of this function is to combine certain enclosures
    Array Device Slot elements into 1. For example, the MINIs/R20s
    have their disk drives spread across multiple enclosures. We
    need to map them all into 1 unit. Another example is that we
    have platforms (M50/60, R50B) that have rear nvme drive bays.
    NVMe doesn't get exposed via a traditional SES device because,
    well, it's nvme. So we create a "fake" nvme "enclosure" that
    mimics the drive slot information that a traditional enclosure
    would do. We take these enclosure devices and simply add them
    to the head-unit enclosure object.

    NOTE: The array device slots have already been mapped to their
    human-readable slot numbers. That logic is in the `Enclosure`
    class in "enclosure_/enclosure_class.py"
