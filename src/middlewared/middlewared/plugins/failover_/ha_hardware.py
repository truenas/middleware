    The echostream E16 JBOD and the echostream Z-series chassis
    are the same piece of hardware. One of the only ways to differentiate
    them is to look at the enclosure elements in detail. The Z-series
    chassis identifies element 0x26 as `ZSERIES_ENCLOSURE` listed below.
    The E16 JBOD does not. The E16 identifies element 0x25 as NM_3115RL4WB66_8R5K5.

    We use this fact to ensure we are looking at the internal enclosure, and
    not a shelf. If we used a shelf to determine which node was A or B, you could
    cause the nodes to switch identities by switching the cables for the shelf.
