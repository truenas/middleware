def calculate_sleep(failure_dt_str: str | None, base_sleep: int = 60) -> int | None:
    """
    Calculates the number of seconds to sleep before the next retry.

    Behavior:
      - If no failure datetime is provided, returns base_sleep (default 60 seconds).
      - If the provided datetime is in the future, returns None.
      - If more than 48 hours have elapsed since the failure datetime, returns None.
      - Otherwise, uses an exponential backoff schedule:
          * First 3 attempts use a sleep time of base_sleep seconds.
          * Next 3 attempts use a sleep time of base_sleep × 2 seconds.
          * Next 3 attempts use a sleep time of base_sleep × 4 seconds, and so on.

        Within each group, the next attempt is scheduled exactly
        at group_interval seconds after the previous attempt.
        If the calculated sleep time is 0 or negative (i.e. we're past the scheduled time),
        returns None (meaning no sleep is needed; try immediately).

    Args:
        failure_dt_str: ISO format datetime string of when the first failure occurred.
                       Used to calculate elapsed time and determine the appropriate retry
                       group and sleep interval. If None, returns base_sleep immediately.
        base_sleep: Base interval in seconds for the exponential backoff calculation.
                   Each retry group uses base_sleep × 2^group_number as the sleep interval.
                   Defaults to 60 seconds if not provided. Higher values result in more
                   conservative retry schedules with longer delays between attempts.
