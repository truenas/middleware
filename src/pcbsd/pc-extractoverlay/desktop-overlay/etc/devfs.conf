# These are examples of how to configure devices using /etc/rc.d/devfs. 
# The first parameter is always the action to take, the second is always the 
# existing device created by devfs, and the last is what you want to change. 
# The name of the action is only significant to the first unique character. 
# 
# Examples: 
 
# Historically X depended on this, but version 4.3.0 doesn't seem to anymore
