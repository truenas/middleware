Jobs
----

Tasks that require significant time to execute or process a large amount of input or output are categorized as jobs.
Job execution can be time-consuming, but its progress can be monitored.

To monitor the progress of running jobs, subscribe to the `core.get_jobs event <api_events_core.get_jobs.html>`_.

When a new job is initiated through a JSON-RPC 2.0 API call, its `message_ids` field will include the `id` of the call.
Therefore, when starting a new job, the client should listen for the `added` event in the `core.get_jobs` subscription.
Additionally, the client should monitor `changed` events because a `changed` event with a new `message_ids` field value
may be emitted if a method call triggers a job that has already been scheduled.

Example of Calling a Job Method
###############################

The client initiates a method call:

.. code:: json

    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "6841f242-840a-11e6-a437-00e04d680384",
        "method": "filesystem.copy",
        "params": ["/mnt/tank/src", "/mnt/tank/dst"]
    }

The server responds with the newly added job (e.g. id 101):

.. code:: json

    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "collection_update",
        "params": {
            "msg": "added",
            "collection": "core.get_jobs",
            "fields": {
                "id": 101,
                "message_ids": ["6841f242-840a-11e6-a437-00e04d680384"],
                ...
            }
        }
    }

Then, it updates the progress:

.. code:: json

    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "collection_update",
        "params": {
            "msg": "changed",
            "collection": "core.get_jobs",
            "fields": {
                "id": 101,
                "progress": {
                    "percent": 50,
                    "description": "Copied 1000000 of 2000000 bytes"
                },
                ...
            }
        }
    }

Finally, it sends the method execution result as usual:

.. code:: json

    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "6841f242-840a-11e6-a437-00e04d680384",
        "result": true
    }

Query Job Status
################

Job status can be queried with the `core.get_jobs` method.

Request:

    :::javascript
    {
      "id": "d8e715be-6bc7-11e6-8c28-00e04d680384",
      "msg": "method",
      "method": "core.get_jobs",
      "params": [[["id", "=", 53]]]
    }

Response:

    :::javascript
    {
      "id": "d8e715be-6bc7-11e6-8c28-00e04d680384",
      "msg": "result",
      "result": [{"id": 53, "method": "catalog.sync_all", "arguments": [], "logs_path": null, "logs_excerpt": null, "progress": {"percent": 100, "description": "Syncing TEST catalog", "extra": null}, "result": null, "error": null, "exception": null, "exc_info": null, "state": "SUCCESS", "time_started": {"$date": 1571300596053}, "time_finished": null}]
    }

Uploading / Downloading Files
#############################

There are some jobs which require input or output as files which can
be uploaded or downloaded.

Downloading a File
******************

If a job gives a file as an output, this endpoint is to be used to download
the output file.

Request:

    :::javascript
    {
        "id": "d8e715be-6bc7-11e6-8c28-00e04d680384",
        "msg": "method",
        "method": "core.download",
        "params": ["config.save", [{}], "freenas-FreeNAS-11.3-MASTER-201910090828-20191017122016.db"]
    }

Response:

    :::javascript
    {
        "id": "cdc8740a-336b-b0cd-b850-47568fe94223",
        "msg": "result",
        "result": [86, "/_download/86?auth_token=9WIqYg4jAYEOGQ4g319Bkr64Oj8CZk1VACfyN68M7hgjGTdeSSgZjSf5lJEshS8M"]
    }

In the response, the first value `86` is the job id for `config.save`. This can be used to query
the status of the job. The second value is a REST endpoint used to download the file.

The download endpoint has a special format:

`http://system_ip/_download/{job_id}?auth_token={token}`

`job_id` and `token` are parameters being passed.

`core.download` takes responsibility for providing the download URI with the `job_id` and `token` values.

Note:
1) Job output is not buffered, so execution would be blocked if a file download is not started.
2) File download must begin within 60 seconds or the job is canceled.
3) The file can only be downloaded once.

Uploading a File
****************

Files can be uploaded via HTTP POST request only. The upload endpoint is:

`http://system_ip/_upload`

It expects two values as form data, `data` and `file`.

`data` is JSON-encoded data. It must be the first parameter provided and in this format:

    ::: json
    {
        "method": "config.upload",
        "params": []
    }

`file` is the URI of the file to download.

This example uses `curl`,

Request:

    curl -X POST -u root:freenas -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F 'data={"method": "config.upload", "params": []}' -F "file=@/home/user/Desktop/config" http://system_ip/_upload/

 Response:

    {"job_id": 20}
